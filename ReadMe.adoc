= Smart Trash Bin Project

This project implements a smart trash bin using an ESP32 microcontroller, ultrasonic sensors, a servo motor, a GPS module, and an OLED display. The bin automatically opens its lid when it detects a hand, measures its fullness level, and sends GPS-based notifications when it's nearly full. It's also integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud platform.

== Step 1: Installation

Follow these steps to install and configure the project:

1. Clone or download the project folder from GitHub.
2. Open the `.ino` file using the Arduino IDE or the Arduino Web Editor.
3. Make sure you have installed the required libraries:
   * Arduino IoT Cloud
   * ESP32 board definitions
   * Adafruit SSD1306
   * Adafruit GFX
   * TinyGPSPlus
   * ESP32Servo
4. Replace the placeholder values in `arduino_secrets.h` with your Wi-Fi credentials and Arduino Cloud credentials.

== Step 2: Assemble the Circuit

Assemble the components following the `layout.png` diagram included in the sketch folder. The project uses the following key connections:

- Ultrasonic Sensor 1 (for hand detection): TRIG - D5, ECHO - D18
- Ultrasonic Sensor 2 (for trash level): TRIG - D2, ECHO - D4
- Servo Motor: D14
- OLED Display (I2C): SDA - D21, SCL - D22
- GPS Module: RX - D32, TX - D33

Refer to the schematic or `layout.png` for full wiring details.

== Step 3: Upload the Code

Upload the code to your ESP32 using the Arduino IDE. Ensure the correct board and port are selected.
